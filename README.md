EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Goal
Analyze a chronic disease dataset to uncover actionable insights into health trends, risk factors, and patient attributes influencing disease prevalence, with the aim of supporting early intervention and healthcare optimization.

## Description
Worked on a dataset containing patient demographics, health conditions, and medical indicators. Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Conducted detailed analysis to study the impact of age, gender, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities on chronic disease occurrence. Generated statistical summaries and visualizations to highlight high-risk groups, identify correlation patterns, and derive insights for preventive healthcare strategies.

## Skills
Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, data visualization, healthcare insights generation.

## Technology
Python â€“ Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook.

## Results
Identified age and lifestyle as critical contributors to chronic disease risk, uncovered gender-specific health trends, and analyzed comorbidity impacts on patients. Delivered insights through visual reports and dashboards that can guide early detection, preventive care programs, and strategic healthcare planning.
